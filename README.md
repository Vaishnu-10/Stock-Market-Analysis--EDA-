 Project Report: Comprehensive Analysis of Twitter Stock Prices

 Introduction
This project involves a thorough analysis of Twitter Inc.'s (TWTR) historical stock prices using Python. The dataset spans from November 2013 to the present day, capturing daily stock market performance metrics. The report details the methods employed, insights gained, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

 Data Overview
The dataset includes the following columns:
- Date: Date of the trading day
- Open: Opening price of the stock on that day
- High: Highest price of the stock during the day
- Low: Lowest price of the stock during the day
- Close: Closing price of the stock on that day
- Adj Close: Adjusted closing price (accounts for corporate actions)
- Volume: Volume of stocks traded on that day

 Methodology and Analysis

1. Data Acquisition and Cleaning
   - Loaded the dataset (`twtr.xlsx`) into Python using Pandas.
   - Checked for and handled missing values by dropping rows with null values.

2. Descriptive Statistics
   - Utilized `.describe()` to generate statistical summaries of numerical columns (`Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Adj Close`, `Volume`).
   - Examined distributions, central tendencies, and variability in stock prices over time.

3. Hypothesis Testing
   - Conducted Z-tests and T-tests on `High`, `Low`, and `Close` columns to evaluate if sample means differ significantly from hypothesized values.
   - Used ANOVA to analyze variance between `High` and `Low` prices across different periods.

4. Dependency Analysis
   - Employed the chi-square test to determine if `High` and `Low` prices are statistically independent.

5. Outlier Detection
   - Identified outliers using Z-score method and visualized them to understand their impact on data integrity.

6. Visualization and Interpretation
   - Utilized Plotly and Seaborn for interactive and static visualizations:
     - Candlestick Charts: Illustrate daily price movements (open, high, low, close).
     - Line Charts: Depict trends in closing prices over time, segmented by years and months.
     - Bar Charts: Show aggregated data trends, such as monthly average closing prices.

7. Conclusion and Insights
   - Conclusion: Twitter's stock exhibits notable volatility and sensitivity to market conditions, as reflected in price fluctuations over time.
   - Insights:
     - Early years post-IPO saw significant price variability, potentially influenced by market sentiment and company developments.
     - Statistical tests indicate significant differences in high and low prices, suggesting potential trading opportunities based on volatility.
     - Outlier analysis highlights extreme price movements that may warrant further investigation.

 Impact and Applications
This analysis offers valuable insights for:
- Investors: Understanding historical price patterns and identifying potential investment opportunities or risks.
- Financial Analysts: Assessing market dynamics and making informed recommendations based on statistical findings.
- Stakeholders: Gaining a comprehensive view of Twitter's stock performance and its implications for strategic decision-making.

 Future Directions
Future iterations of this analysis could explore:
- Incorporating sentiment analysis of news and social media to gauge their impact on stock price movements.
- Implementing machine learning models for predictive analytics and trend forecasting.
- Expanding the dataset to include additional financial metrics for a holistic view of Twitter's market performance.
